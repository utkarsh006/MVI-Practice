- **Step 1 :** Create your Model classes. These are the classes that hold your data and business logic. They should be designed to be immutable and contain all the necessary information needed for the View to display and interact with.

- **Step 2 :** Create your View classes. These are the classes that display your UI to the user. They should be designed to be passive and only display information to the user. They should also be responsible for sending user input events to the Presenter.

- **Step 3 :** Create your Intent classes. These are the classes that represent the user's intent to perform an action. They should be designed to be immutable and contain all the necessary information needed for the Presenter to perform the desired action.

- **Step 4 :** Create your Presenter classes. These are the classes that receive user input events from the View and perform the necessary business logic using the Model classes. They should be designed to be stateless and only perform actions in response to incoming Intents.

- **Step 5 :** Connect your View and Presenter using an interface. This interface should define methods that the Presenter can use to send updated state information to the View, and methods that the View can use to send user input events to the Presenter.

- **Step 6 :** Connect your Presenter and Model using dependency injection. This will allow the Presenter to access the Model classes without creating any tight coupling between the two.
